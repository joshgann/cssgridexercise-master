    Goal: Create a grid with 9-12 children block elements with
    the display grid property

    Grid Elements
      - Create a <main> containing block
      - Create 9-12 children <section> elements within the <main>
      - For inspiration, check out the following resources for help +
        what kind of grid design you would like to create:

    Content Elements
      - each section needs an <h2> heading
      - Place placeholder text inside some children,
        and an <img> in others using placehold.it
      - Create at least one link with a hover
        pseudo-class effect
      - Create an unordered list with checkmarks
        inside one of the child elements
      - Apply an alternating background color scheme
        using .bg-color class and nth-child() to the
        child <section> elements
      - Create / play around with any other content/grid declarations.
        If you need more inspiration, here are some examples that I
        keep for my 3844 class: https://codepen.io/collection/DdNPVo/
